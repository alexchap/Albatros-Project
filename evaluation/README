Files are generated and the rows of a file for a router represents :
1) evolution of Import updates received
2) evolution of Import withdraws received
2) evolution of import updates damped

--- SECOND STEP ---

Rename the processed directory to SIMX for simulation X
do the first step for other simulation if needed

--- THIRD STEP ---

Use the matlab scripts in order to generate graphs and comparisons
