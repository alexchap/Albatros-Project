--- FIRST STEP ---

Untar the desired archive from the data directory

Call the script process_stats.pl in order to generate the evolution of 
statistics that are saved in the stats directory
The results are saved in the processed directory

Files are generated and the rows of a file for a router represents :
1) evolution of Import updates received
2) evolution of Import withdraws received
2) evolution of import updates damped

--- SECOND STEP ---

Rename the processed directory to EXPN for simulation N

--- THIRD STEP ---

Use the matlab scripts in order to generate graphs and comparisons
If you want to compare experiments, do the first and second step for
each experiment results you need
