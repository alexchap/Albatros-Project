Another source of BGP dumps is RIPE RIS, e.g.:
http://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc00/2003.04/bview.20030408.0000.gz

A good table to map ASNs to their own name is available at
http://www.potaroo.net/bgp/iana/asn-ctl.txt .


To test aslookup.pl you can set $format = 1 and then run:

zcat bview.20030321.1600.gz | time ./zebra-dump-parser.pl >DUMP 2>DUMPERR
sort < DUMP | uniq | time ./aggregate-by-asn.pl > routes.tmp
mv routes.tmp routes

Please let me know if you ever find a use for this software.
I *know* that many people are downloading it, but nobody ever reports back...
