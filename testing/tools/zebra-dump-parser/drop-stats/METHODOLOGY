A routing table snapshot is downloaded from the RIPE RIS archive.
Each as-path of each route is processed and the last and second-last
autonomous systems in the paths are recorded as the origin of the route
and its "neighbor" networks (prepends are ignored).

Beware: determining transit vs. peering vs. customer relationships is a
non-trivial problem, so the last two tables may contain unexpected results.

Networks are considered "evil" if they only announce listed networks.
If they also announce non-listed networks, they are merely "bad".

The first table only considers networks announced by the AS being
considered, networks announced by downstream ASes are not counted there.
