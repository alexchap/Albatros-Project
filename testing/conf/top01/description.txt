# Sample config for a simple topology

# Overview
- two router
- Basic BGP configuration between the two router
- both listen on port 179

 <rta>:10.10.10.11 <------> 10.10.10.12<rtb>
	AS 65011	      AS 65012

# Steps to follow

1) Wire rta<->rtb with rj45
2) Ip configuration

rta :
> ip addr add 10.10.10.11/32 dev eth0
> ip ro add 10.10.10.12/32 dev eth0

rtb :
> ip addr add 10.10.10.12/32 dev eth0
> ip ro add 10.10.10.11/32 dev eth0

try a ping between the two -> it should work
Equivalently : test connection on a port (eg 179 for BGP)
rta : 
> nc -l 179
rtb : 
> nc 10.10.10.11 179
> type some text here that should appear on the other side !

3) Start ssh server on one host -> access to both from one computer 
-> don't have to switch screens if two different computers

4) start bird on each router by using the option -c and the appropriate 
configuration file


NOTES

- in order to spend less time writing ip addresses, edit the /etc/hosts file
and add the following lines 
10.10.10.11 rta
10.10.10.12 rtb
Like that, you can use simple names instead of ip addresses :-)
