In each topology, we have the following scripts :

- configure_interface.sh : configure your linux laptop & start daemons
- reset.sh : reset to initial configuration
- configuration files of bird daemons used (eg. rta.conf)
- start_bird.sh : if your daemons are down, just start them again !
- useful_commands.txt : what commands shall I use to see logs and debug msg ?
- description.txt : description of the topology
