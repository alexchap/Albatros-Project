- FIX compilation problem when no damping -> can we define a conditional grammar in config.Y ?
  i.e if route damping is disabled, no need to create damping_config !
  same question for including dampin.c in the makefile -> conditional ?

- Paramters without underscore !?
- Ipv6 version !? -> in packets.c
