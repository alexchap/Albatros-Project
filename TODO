TODO project albatros

Status : 8th December 2011

Priorities

- damping.c : Fix ambiguity with variable names proto vs. p
- damping :  Create a function show damped routes & enable it from birdc interface
  -> use cli_msg (see bgp.c and ospf.c for example of use)
  -> Add CLI messages to config file parser (config.Y)
- damping : Create a flap statistics struct
  -> we need statistics about flapping routes
- Separate the cases when routes are UNreachable or reachable 
  -> we need more arrays in the damping_config
- Testing : two route flaps + many neighbors  

- FIX compilation problem when no damping -> can we define a conditional grammar in config.Y ?
  i.e if route damping is disabled, no need to create damping_config !
  same question for including dampin.c in the makefile -> conditional ?

Not too urgent

- Paramters without underscore !?
- Documentation
- Test it on real scale
- Ipv6 version !? -> in packets.c
