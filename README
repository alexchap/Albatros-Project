This git repository contains all the code developed for the implementation
of RFC 2439 BGP Route flap damping for the Bird Routing project. 
The modified bird is located in the bird directory. Before compiling it
please configure it with the option --enable-route-damping.

Example : 
cd bird
autoconf
./configure --enable-route damping [other options if needed]
make
sudo make install


The folder testing contains contains the following 
- some tools to generate packets (mdfmt) and parse routeviews archives 
(zebra dump parser)
- 4 simple topologies for small scale tests (in conf directory) that run 
on the current machine
- Some cool script to test the implementation on a "real scale" basis 
(real scale directory) -> topology with 27 routers and 10 AS's.
For real scale testing, the configuration of interfaces and IPS
was already done on the cluster nslrack55.epfl.ch. (Networked system
Laboratory, EPFL, Switzerland)


The folder evaluation contains all the code needed to analyze and parse logs
generated by the collector, along with the matlab script needed to compare
experiments and generate nice graphs.

"references" directory.
